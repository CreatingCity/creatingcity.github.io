In our meeting we exchange ideas about Smart City theme dissemination at School and how it is possible to bring this theme discussions for students and teachers?

In front of this talk, Instituto Aldeia define a new thematic for organizing activities in the Institute: Innovative Technologies and Educative Society.

We are pleased to exchange knowledge and meet incredible projects such as the Instituto Aldeia.
