## Our history

This team of researchers emerged around 2016 with the goals of investigation cuttin-edge solutions for cities.

With several meetings, workshops and conference we were able to engage more than 50 researchers in the journey of
studying the future of digital and smart cities.
The proceedings of some events organized by the team and partners can be accessed [here](/proceedings/).

In the last 2 year, the team has been conducting research mostly in Brazil and Spain.
