We are very proud to announce the **Workshop on High Performance Computing for Smart Cities (WHPCSC 2019)** will be held as a workshop inside the [SBAC PAD 2019](http://sbac-pad.facom.ufms.br/), on October 15-18, Campo Grande, MS.

## Call for papers

The interaction between humans have shaped our world, giving birth to modern
societies, and cities. Machines are now a fundamental part of this development,
sharing space with citizens in our cities, consuming and producing information. This
new paradigm is being called the Smart Cities. The building blocks of a smart city are
technological devices capable of communicating, processing information and
becoming part of the decision-making, but this requires high-performance computing
capabilities. Besides promoting a decentralization of the current system, the new
cities open doors for different autonomous agents to optimize their own interests. In
this context, combinatorial optimization plays a fundamental role for more precise,
efficient and balanced decision making. In addition, interaction with citizens is not
overlooked, new tools contribute to a more transparent society by promoting a
participatory and developed economy. Transparency is also being explored through
peer-to-peer technologies and distributed ledgers such as blockchain, where
scalability currently poses big challenges to evolution of the systems. It is required
that such advances take place in a sustainable manner, due to limited existing
resources being harnessed, boosting the adoption of energy-efficient devices. This
universe of possibilities opens doors for researchers to devise distinct environments
of complex and multicriteria decisions.

**Previous editions:**

This workshop is strongly connected to four others on Smart City topic, organized
since 2017 by the Creating.City group (see [https://creating.city/proceedings](https://creating.city/proceedings)). The
HPC topic has always been a subject on past workshops, together with computational
intelligence, so a more directed name was chosen this time to attract more of the HPC
community.

## Topics of interest include

Suggested topics but not limited to:

* Applications of HPC to Smart Cities
* Citizens and HPC Solutions on Smart Cities
* Computational Intelligence on HPC devices
* HPC for Autonomous and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)
* HPC for Consensus and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)
* HPC for Decentralized Systems on Smart Cities
* HPC for Decision-making on Green Logistics
* HPC for Digital Signatures and Cryptography
* HPC for Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Internet-of-Value (IoV)
* HPC Systems and Analysis on Smart City scenarios
* Scalability on Decentralized Ledgers
* Smart Grid optimization using HPC
